A shop in London has 2 million IoT tracking devices in the warehouse for sale, of which half needs configured to meet UK standards. A configured device will have a status "READY" and an ideal temperature between (-25'C to 85'C).
The configuration process requires a given IoT device to be associated with a SIM (Subscriber Identification Module) card. The SIM card holds information such as:
•    SIM ID - uniquely identify the SIM card.
•    Operator code – uniquely identify a mobile operator
•    Country – country name, e.g. Italy
•    Status – devices status can be Active, waiting for activation, Blocked or Deactivated.
 
The shop can sell a device only if it meets the UK government's industry standard.

Task:
Using the Java programming language, develop a REST API that 
a.    Returns all devices in the warehouse that are waiting for activation. 
        
   /warehouse/devices?status=WAITING_FOR_ACTIVATION
   
b.    Management endpoints that enable the shop manager to remove or update a device configuration status.
    
    /warehouse/devices
    /warehouse/sim
    /warehouse/configure

c.    Returns an ordered result of devices available for sale.

    /warehouse/devices/{status}

d.    Expected response format should be in JSON.
